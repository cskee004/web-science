Rick Scott of Florida issued a dire warning about the expected storm surge from Helene, which could be a Category 4 hurricane before it makes landfall, saying it won’t be survivable.","“In the Big Bend, they’re talking about possibly 18-foot of storm surge,” Scott said in Taylor County. “I’m a little over 6 feet — that’s three times my height. None of us are living that.”","Other parts of the coast are forecast to get 10 or 12 feet of storm surge, he said. Scott told people to evacuate and said no homes or possessions are worth dying for.","“You’re not going to survive. I mean, you’re not going to live through this stuff,” Scott said."]},"cardData":{"graphics":[]},"date":{"createdAt":"2024-09-26T04:09:18.133Z","publishedAt":"2024-09-26T04:09:18.133Z","modifiedAt":"2024-09-26T04:10:25.749Z"},"description":{"primary":"U.S. Sen.","seo":"U.S. Sen.","social":"Florida Sen.
