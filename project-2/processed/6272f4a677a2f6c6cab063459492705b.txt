BERENSON LIBRARY
The Berenson Library plays a vital role in I Tattiâ€™s mission to advance scholarship in Italian Renaissance studies. Its rich collections of books and periodicals, photographs and digital images, manuscripts and recordings offer comprehensive interdisciplinary resources for the study of late medieval and early modern Italy, the library's central focus. As one of the over seventy libraries that make up the Harvard Library system, the Biblioteca Berenson also provides access to a vast range of online journals and other electronic resources. An invaluable point of reference for I Tatti's scholarly community, the library welcomes other Harvard affiliates, local researchers, and visiting scholars from around the world.
