Just months ago, Brenton Cross graduated from Virginia Peninsula Community College, receiving an Associate of Applied Sciences degree in Electrical Engineering Technology (EET). He’s due to return to VPCC spring semester.
He won’t be the one taking notes and doing assignments, though. He’ll be an adjunct faculty member in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics division. Cross is eager to share his knowledge with students in the EET program.
“Being fresh out of the program, I feel like I can bring a different perspective to the material. Maybe I can reach someone in a way that wasn’t possible before,” said Cross, noting he hopes to connect with students who might benefit from his blend of industry experience and recent academic success.
The path to becoming an educator wasn’t traditional. His career began taking shape after he graduated from Southhampton High School in 2011 and enrolled at William & Mary, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in psychology.
Cross thought he’d found his niche as an in-school counselor for behaviorally challenged students. Employed by a contractor, he spent three years serving Franklin City Public Schools and Isle of Wight. However, his career truly took off when he joined Newport News Shipbuilding in June 2020.
“I was an electrician for two years. When I got into The Apprentice School (in Newport News), there were different tracks you could take. I took electricity in high school, so I knew a little bit about it. When I got to the Apprentice School, I chose shipboard electrical route,” he explained.
Once Cross believed he peaked as an electrician, he wanted a change of pace.
“I transitioned to supply chain compliance. My current position is a regulatory compliance analyst and, I’ve been in this role for a little over a year,” he said, noting the role involves auditing the supply chain to ensure everything aligns with protocol. “That’s probably the most interesting thing I do.”
The Apprentice School, where he is slated to finish in March 2025, led Cross to pursue college coursework. He enrolled at VPCC in 2023 after completing several classes at Tidewater Community College. He counts his VPCC student experiences as a huge boon to his career.
“I feel like the nature of the labs and the project-based nature of the curriculum helped me further myself in my career because it made me resourceful,” he said
The move from recent graduate to adjunct instructor at VPCC was unexpected.
“There were two professors running the program. So, (a classmate) and I, with our shipyard experience, naturally started helping out in the classroom. We had a leg up because of our background in electricity, so we broke down the information for our classmates. Eventually, Prof. (Jean) Frank noticed and asked if we’d be interested in teaching,” Cross recalled.
While teaching is a new venture, it aligns with his long-term goals.
“I don’t want to just teach I want to be an effective educator. I plan to get a master’s degree and work toward higher-level teaching,” he noted.
Outside of work, the Franklin, Va. resident spends time with his wife, Shante, and their three children. He is grateful to his wife for pushing him to pursue his dreams.
“She knew counseling wasn’t the ceiling for me. She inspired me to reach far above that. If it wasn’t for her, I might not have taken this route.”
Cross admits he’s rarely idle. He’s also working on turning his hobby of residential building into something more substantial.
“I’m pursuing a contractor’s license right now, and I plan to go back to VPCC to earn a Certificate in Architecture. It’s something that has always interested me.”
Preparing to step into the classroom, he’s looking forward to not just teaching but making a meaningful impact.
“I hope to reach students in a way that helps them see the potential in themselves,” he enthused.
He views this teaching opportunity as a full-circle moment. With a passion for education and deep well of experience from which to draw, he’s poised to make a lasting impression at Virginia Peninsula Community College.
