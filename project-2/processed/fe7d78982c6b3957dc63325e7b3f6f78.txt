Ensuring a Safe, Respectful and Inclusive Commencement
Each year, Harvard's dedicated faculty, staff, alumni, and students come together to plan a commencement ceremony that honors the achievements and bright futures of our outstanding graduates. Commencement is a time to reflect on the contributions of all within our Harvard community who support our students' success. Our top priority is to honor and celebrate our graduates in a way that is safe, respectful, and inclusive for all as degree candidates mark this major milestone in their lives.
Commencement ceremonies have, over centuries of tradition, provided an opportunity for peaceful expression on important issues. We support respectful dialogue while prioritizing safety. Security will be present to facilitate an atmosphere where graduates and guests can fully participate in the ceremony.
Specific security measures include:
Screening all guests at entry gates for prohibited items
Requiring tickets for entry into Harvard Yard
Restricting backpacks, large bags, and other items that could pose safety risks
Prohibiting signs or banners that block views or disrupt the ceremony
Most of all, we hope this celebration honors the hard work of our newest alumni.
