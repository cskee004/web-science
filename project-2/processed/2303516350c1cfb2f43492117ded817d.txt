Annual Report 2022-2023
The Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University (MCZ) is a private center for research and education focused on the comparative relationships of animal life.  The MCZ houses millions of animal specimens divided into nine departments and hosts hundreds of visiting researchers each year.
Public exhibits of MCZ specimens can be found at the Harvard Museum of Natural History , a member of the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture.
The MCZ stands with all people and organizations working to end racism and social injustice. We acknowledge the role of the Museum, and especially its founder, Louis Agassiz, in fostering ideas of racial disparity and inequality that underlie historical attitudes towards African Americans and other people of color—ideas that we soundly reject. As an institution devoted to education, research and public outreach, we are committed to developing programs that will earnestly evaluate these attitudes and promote contemporary solutions, and to offering new educational and research opportunities in the Museum for people who until now may have felt unwelcome or excluded.
