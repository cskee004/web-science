Over the past several years, leggings have become a wardrobe staple. Pair them with a sports bra and sneakers to wear to your favorite workout. Throw on a t-shirt and flats; they’re a comfy option for running errands or brunch. Or, throw on a slouchy top, some jewelry and boots and you can wear them to dinner. The best part? While there are plenty of expensive options on the market, there are also several affordable options on Amazon. To help you shop for leggings on Amazon, we sourced highly rated options and a few NBC Select staff favorites—all of which you can get with free shipping if you have a Prime membership .
