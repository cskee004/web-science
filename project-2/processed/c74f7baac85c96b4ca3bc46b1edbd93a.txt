British actress and singer Naomi Scott, who plays pop star Skye Riley in the upcoming film “Smile 2,” said her character drew inspiration from some of the pop stars here tonight.
As for the movie itself, slated to release in theaters Oct. 18, the first-time VMA attendee teased it as being “kind of like the first movie, but on steroids and a lot of party drugs.
“It’s very intense, but it’s so fun and so unhinged and also kind of funny,” Scott said. “My director brought me in to watch some of the edit, and I remember just being like, I wish I was here with my best friend, because we would just be grabbing each other laughing and screaming.”

'Dreams don’t have deadlines:' LL Cool J on his first album in a decade
Kaetlyn Liddy Kaetlyn Liddy is a newsroom coordinator for NBC News Digital.
After a 10-year break from releasing music, LL Cool J dropped his 14th studio album, "The Force," on Friday.
"I wanted to show the people that I came up with that your dreams don't have deadlines," he said on the MTV pre-show. "You could continue to do this thing at a high level. You don't have to be successful at one age and then all of a sudden taper off and wallow around in mediocrity."
He is set to perform in tonight’s ceremony, but the legendary artist's relationship with the VMAs started 27 years ago. LL Cool J became the first rap artist to win the Video Vanguard Award in 1997, which he noted as his favorite VMAs moment.
"I am a kid raised on hip hop ... So that was an unbelievable moment," he said of the honor.

Jordan Chiles makes VMAs debut after bronze medal debacle
Kaetlyn Liddy Kaetlyn Liddy is a newsroom coordinator for NBC News Digital.
Two-time Olympic champion Jordan Chiles made her first public appearances on Wednesday since she was stripped of her bronze medal from the Paris Olympic Games.
"This is a dream come true to be able to come to the VMAs," Chiles said. "Meeting people, especially celebrities out here." Despite the big names in the room, Chiles said her Olympic resume has prepared her for this moment.
Competing is "harder than doing an interview," she joked.
Hours before the VMAs ceremony, Chiles spoke at the Forbes Power Women’s Summit in New York City, where she said the controversy was more about "peace" and "justice" for her than the medal itself.
"The biggest thing that was taken from me was the recognition of who I was, not just my sport, but the person I am ... the star is never going to get dimmed." she said.
