What Oprah's board exit means for WW International
Shares of WW International (WW), known as Weight Watchers, fell after Oprah Winfrey announced she would not seek reelection to the company's board. Winfrey cited her desire to avoid conflicts with her own use of the weight loss drug Ozempic. Despite this, D.A. Davidson's Linda Bolton Weiser reiterated her bullish view on Yahoo Finance Live. She notes Oprah has been "reducing her stake" for some time, and believes the company's operating results outweigh Winfrey's departure. Weiser claims her price target remains the same given Weight Watchers' "turnaround." She sees stabilization in the core business with growing users and clinical offerings.

Healthcare stocks: The case for providers vs. insurers
Hospital revenue has grown by nearly 8% year-to-date in 2024. While hospital and medical costs are aiming to moderate, what does this entail for healthcare stocks and the sector at large? TD Cowen Senior Equity Research Analyst Gary Taylor joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the firm's top healthcare names. "We came into the year saying we want to own the providers over the health insurers for the first half of the year, and anticipating by the time we pivoted to the back half, we'd be in a position to recommend payers over providers," Taylor explains. "We're currently in the first half of the year, obviously. We're still in the provider trade. Our favorite names are HCA [Healthcare] (HCA) — largest hospital company in the US — Acadia [Pharmaceuticals] (ACAD), which is one of the largest free-standing behavioral providers, and then also Surgery Partners (SGRY), which is an ambulatory surgery center company."

Capitalizing on the housing market with ADUs: Samara CEO
While home buying is down, housing prices remain high as inventory remains low. This has caused a boom in the construction of Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs). The state of California recently passed legislation that allows homeowners to build and sell ADUs on their own residential lots. Mike McNamara, Samara CEO, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss how his business aims to capitalize on this phenomenon by building customized units for prospective buyers. McNamara explains the soaring demand for ADUs: "Adding just the cost of the unit itself on to the backyard and be able to get full rental income is very attractive, and it almost creates an immediate free cash flow impact for many areas of California. So what California does is trying to stimulate this housing, more and more housing units. It's affordable by nature because the units are smaller so they tend to rent for less or cost less to build, and so it appeals to many different customers. But the demand for these ADUs on the back of all of these law changes, since 2016 to now, has gone up right about 20x, and it's currently the largest permit request for this form factor is the highest of any in California right now."

Expect first Fed rate cut in June, economist explains
The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which removes food and energy from the inflation equation, increased 2.8% in the month of January, marking the lowest annual increase since March of 2021. It has been said by many that this index is the Federal Reserve's preferred gauge of interest. Will this finally be enough for the Fed to cut interest rates? RSM US Economist Tuan Nguyen joins the Live show to discuss why he believes the US is inching closer to the finish line for the Fed's target inflation. In terms of rate cuts, Nguyen says: "We think that there's quite a good chance that we might actually get to 2% by mid-year for the overall inflation, PCE inflation, and for core PCE inflation we might settle around 2.5%, all because of that cooldown in housing inflation. So that really continues to reaffirm our forecast that we made last December that we might expect the first rate cut around June this year."

How Salesforce is seriously investing in itself
Shares of Salesforce (CRM) are moving up as the company reported fourth-quarter earnings, posting adjusted earnings per share of $2.29 versus an expected $2.27. The company did, however, forecast a weak sales growth of only an estimated 8.6% growth. In addition, the company announced it will eventually be issuing dividends to shareholders. Macquarie Head of AI & Software Research Fred Havemeyer joins Yahoo Finance to discuss Salesforce's earnings and what to expect from the company going forward. Havemeyer speaks on the shareholder dividend news: "With the addition of a dividend here and the company also consistently returning capital to investors through buybacks, what we're seeing is that we believe Salesforce here is really showing their dedication to deploying their cash flows in ways that are rewarding investors and their confidence in Salesforce. And so, where the company is focusing again on profitability and cash flows, and growing those cash flows nicely, north of 20% year-over-year in 2025, fiscal '25, they see this as an opportunity to return more cash to shareholders." He continues: "It adds a very nice aspect to this story, that you can follow along for the growth, for the upside from AI, but you're also being rewarded with both more margin, more profitability, more cash flows, and at the end of the day, more cash being returned to investors."

Choice Hotels stock is a 'win-win': Analyst
As part of Yahoo Finance's Travel Guide 2024: Industry Insights special, Baird Senior Research Analyst Michael Bellisario sharwes his top hotel stock pick: Choice Hotels (CHH). He calls Choice a "win-win" situation. If Choice's acquisition of Wyndham Hotels & Resorts (WH) is approved, Bellisario sees significant synergy given that "bigger is better" in the hotel franchising industry. Even if the deal fails, he values Choice's "stand-alone" plan due to its strong balance sheet and earnings recovery. Bellisario notes brands like Marriott (MAR) and Hilton (HLT) benefit from business travel loyalty. However, Choice and Wyndham rewards are more "immediate" while appealing to lower-end leisure guests. Still, merging could boost loyalty and rewards across both brands.
