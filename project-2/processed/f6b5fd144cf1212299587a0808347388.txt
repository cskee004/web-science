History
The H.C. Fung Library was founded in 2005, bringing together the libraries of the former Coolidge Hall, including:
the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies Library,
the Japan Digital Resource Center (formerly the Documentation Center on Contemporary Japan),
and the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies Library.
The library collects resources related to international politics, foreign relations, foreign policy, economics, sociology, and political science of China, Japan, Russia and Eurasia.
Librarians with expertise in a designated area of the world and affiliated with a particular research institute select the library's holdings.
