The stars aligned perfectly for Kolby Hoge just after college graduation. He received a degree in Graphic and Media Design from Virginia Peninsula Community College in May then started a highly competitive internship about three weeks later.
This opportunity is a huge step for Hoge, who wants a career in the entertainment industry. His internship at WSKY (SKY 4) involves creating digital ads and assisting with producing commercials.
For him, the hands-on experience is the most exciting part.
“I am thrilled to gain real-world experience in the entertainment field and see how what I’ve learned at VPCC translates into the workforce,” said Hoge, noting the internship began June 3 and lasts through July 26.
He learned about the internship when VPCC students were invited to visit the television station in Hampton.
“During the field trip, my classmates and I were presented with an application to apply for an internship through the Virginia Association of Broadcasters,” Hoge explained.
He earned the spot after a rigorous selection process.
Networking is another critical aspect of the internship for Hoge. He hopes to establish valuable connections that will help him get a full-time job afterward.
“I aim to leverage this experience to build a network that will support my career ambitions,” he added, thanking the Virginia Association of Broadcasters for the opportunity.
A graduate of Yorktown’s Grafton High School, Hoge enrolled at the College in the summer of 2022. He chose VPCC to explore career options while managing costs. His passion for entertainment led him to major in Graphic and Media Design. He also studied digital video, for which he earned a certificate in May.
"VPCC’s graphic and media program is highly ranked, and it has equipped me with essential skills for the workplace," Hoge noted, thanking the program’s faculty for their expertise, influence and support.
With an associate degree and certificate in hand, he is looking ahead. He plans to continue working in entertainment, gaining the needed experience to start his own company.
He said family support has been a cornerstone of his success.
"My entire family supports what I do, and I have a great circle around me that encourages me to succeed in whatever field I pursue," he acknowledged.
Reflecting on his experiences, Hoge has good advice for current and future VPCC students who share his academic interests.
“While in school, I was nervous about what would come after graduation. But VPCC’s Graphic and Media Design program provides great skills and opens many doors to fantastic opportunities,” he said. “I strongly encourage other graphic students to apply for internships, as they are invaluable for career readiness.”
