Apple is launching an iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max models on September 13. The new models, as well as iPhone 15 models, will all have Apple Intelligence , which are AI features giving you various benefits that make generating photos, writing and communication via text better. Some of its key AI features include proofreading, changing the tone of an email or creating custom generative emojis. For example, you could create a yellow smiley face with cucumbers over its eyes or have a squirrel DJ’ing. You can also type in Messages or Notes apps, and AI will attempt to pull up relevant photos or videos into your chat. The iPhone Pro also has four more hours of battery life compared to the previous model, according to the brand.
