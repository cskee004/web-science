How a balance transfer credit card can help you save
Not only is credit card interest expensive, but it’s as high as it’s ever been. Today’s average credit card interest rate is around 21% — higher than at any other point since the Federal Reserve began tracking rates in the 1990s.
Compared to those double-digit interest rates, it’s not difficult to see how even a limited-time 0% APR can help you save on debt payoff.
You can maximize your balance transfer savings by planning to pay your balance in full before the intro period ends. But even if that’s impossible, you can still shave months and potentially thousands of dollars of your total amount paid. How much you save depends on a few details, including the length of your intro period and how much you can pay each month.
Balance transfer example
Let’s say you have a credit card balance of $5,500 today — about average, according to a report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau — on a card earning 21%. Here’s what your journey to pay down debt could look like over a few different scenarios:
Minimum payments: This is by far the most costly option. Making only minimum payments , you would add nearly $9,000 in interest over more than two decades before paying your balance off in full. Total paid: $14,499
Fixed monthly payment: You can minimize costs by paying more than your monthly minimum, even if you cannot pay your balance in full. Maybe you can afford to contribute a fixed payment of $200 each month toward your debt. In this case, you’ll pay your balance in full after three years, but still add more than $2,000 to your total balance. Total paid: $7,566
Now, let’s see how a balance transfer credit card could make a difference in your $5,500 debt. This card comes with an 18-month 0% introductory APR and a 3% balance transfer fee (more on that below). After the intro period, you’ll take on the same 21% APR.
Pay in full: If you can put at least $314 toward your credit card bill each month, you could wipe out your balance in full by the end of the intro period, without paying any additional interest. The only payment added to your principal is the 3% fee, equal to $165. Total paid: $5,665
Fixed monthly payment: If the amount you need to pay in full is out of your budget , you can still save with a balance transfer offer. Maybe you can still afford the same $200 monthly payment as before the transfer. Over the introductory period, you would pay down $3,600 of your principal balance, lowering your debt to $2,065. Once the APR starts to accrue, you could cover the remainder in one year with only $235 in added interest. Transferring your balance would allow you to pay your balance in full over 30 months and with about $400 in added interest and fees. Total paid: $5,900
Factors to consider when choosing the best balance transfer card
There are many factors to consider for a balance transfer credit card, most notably whether this is right for your credit journey. Make sure you're considering your credit history and reading what terms apply. Don't get caught up in bonus offers, rewards bonuses or promotional periods until you ensure opening another credit card is right for you.
Introductory APR: Usually set for a certain period, an introductory rate is the percentage your account charges if you carry a balance. Often, this is 0% APR when you open a new account.
Regular APR: APR stands for annual percentage rate, the percentage you get charged by the credit lender each payment period you carry a balance. This will most likely be different than your intro rate. Sometimes, cards have variable APR, which means your rate goes up and down over time.
Annual fees: The financial institution might charge an annual fee for having your account with the company. Annual fee cards are often tied to traveling or points programs.
Balance transfer fees: If you want to transfer debt to an existing balance from one credit card to another institution, the lender can charge you a fee. This is usually a percentage of your transfer amount. It's a common occurrence to be charged when you transfer your balance.
Your credit score: A credit score is a number that represents your credit health, which determines what cards you're eligible for. This can sometimes be referred to as a FICO score. There are multiple credit reporting agencies where you can request a free credit report that details your credit history, like how many credit card accounts you've had. Credit scores range from 300-850. Above 700 is considered good credit, and above 800 is considered excellent credit. By paying your cards on time, accumulating less interest, and not carrying a balance, you can move your credit from good to excellent.
Balance transfer credit card costs and fees
You can save a lot of money with a balance transfer credit card, but you should still prepare for the potential costs you’ll incur.
Balance transfer cards don’t typically carry an annual fee. However, there is often a fee for transferring your balance. Balance transfer fees can range from 3%-5% of your overall balance, usually with a minimum of around $5.
Say you want to transfer a $3,000 balance to a card with a 0% intro APR and a 3% balance transfer fee. The balance transfer would cost you $90 in total. The larger your balance, the more you’ll pay for the balance transfer. Still, these fees are likely only a small fraction of the interest you would otherwise pay.
Some balance transfer credit cards waive this fee. If you have a very high balance that could lead to a costly fee — or you want to avoid any added cost altogether — you may want to focus on balance transfer cards with no fee.
Balance transfer credit card pros and cons
There are both pros and cons of balance transfers. While benefits include the intro APR period or intro APR offer, cons include balance transfer fees and lower credit limits.
Pros
0% introductory APR: When you use a balance transfer card with an introductory 0% APR offer, any payments you make throughout the intro period will go directly toward your principal balance. Instead of interest making it more challenging to pay off your debt, you can use this tool to eliminate the underlying balance.
No annual fee: The best balance transfer cards available today have no annual fee, so you don’t have to worry about any additional cost of owning the card.
Debt consolidation: If you have balances spread across multiple credit cards, you may be able to consolidate them onto a single balance transfer card. Not only can you benefit from the period of interest-free payments, but you’ll also minimize the number of individual monthly payments you need to remember (make sure the total transferred balance is less than your card’s credit limit).
Cons
Risk of not paying your balance off in full: You may not be able to maximize your balance transfer if you cannot prioritize your monthly payments over the intro period. These cards work best if you can commit to paying down a significant portion of your balance over the 0% APR offer. Otherwise, you’ll be left with a growing balance once again when your regular interest rate begins.
Balance transfer fees: The fees issuers charge to make your transfer can add to your overall balance. But for most cardholders, a 3% or 5% fee will still be far less than the amount you would otherwise accrue in interest charges.
Credit limits: Make sure you know your balance transfer credit card’s credit limit before you attempt to make your transfer. If your existing debt is more than the limit, you won’t be able to transfer the entire balance.
3 ways to maximize your balance transfer credit card
Take advantage of your new card. Not only is a balance transfer credit card a great way to pay down debt, but it can also set you up for a better financial future. Here are three things you should do when you open up a new card:
1. Make the most of your introductory 0% APR
The introductory period on your balance transfer card only lasts so long. Take full advantage by transferring your balance as soon as possible after approval. If your new card offers an 18-month 0% APR intro period, but you wait two months to make your transfer, it’ll only be more difficult to pay down your debt in that shorter time frame.
Some balance transfer cards even require you to transfer your balance within a specific timeframe. For example, your card agreement may specify that the 0% APR offer applies to transfers made within the first 30 days of account opening. Alternatively, you could take on a more significant balance transfer fee the longer you wait. For example, there may only be a 3% fee for balances transferred within 60 days of account opening, but a 5% fee for balances transferred after that time.
2. Focus on debt payoff
Throughout the intro period, prioritize only paying down your debt — without making new purchases that increase your balance. You’ll leave yourself with more to pay off before the intro period ends.
Instead, focus on buying only what you can afford to pay off in full. Whether you make purchases with another credit card or use your debit card or cash, ensure you have enough money in the bank to cover your spending.
This may also help you become more aware of any spending habits that led to taking on the debt in the first place so you can avoid ending up in the same place again.
3. Think about the long-term
If debt payoff is your priority, long-term rewards or benefits may not be the biggest concern when choosing your balance transfer card, but they are worth considering.
Balance transfer credit cards with the longest introductory 0% APR periods (up to 21 months) typically offer few ongoing benefits. They are designed for cardholders looking to pay off as much debt as possible over a more extended period.
On the other hand, credit cards with balance transfer offers and ongoing rewards or other benefits tend to have slightly shorter intro periods of around 12 to 15 months. Even after you pay down your debt, these cards can offer long-term value on your everyday purchases. Just make sure you plan to avoid overspending and taking on debt again.
Should you open a balance transfer card?
Only you can decide if opening a new account is right for you. This type of credit card can help if you're in debt or have high-interest debt. But you should consider how this card will affect your credit journey or if you might need to research other options. Think about these things before you make your decision:
Alternative options
It’s important to remember that a balance transfer isn’t your only option for debt payoff. Consolidating debt with a personal loan may be a better option for some people.
If your debt far exceeds the credit limit on a new balance transfer card or you need more time than you can find among 0% APR offers today, opting for a personal loan with a fixed APR lower than your current credit card could be a good solution.
Credit impact
Not only do you need good credit to qualify for a balance transfer card, but a balance transfer itself can also potentially affect your credit.
For one, when you open any new credit card (including a balance transfer card), the required hard inquiry on your credit could lead to a small, temporary credit score drop. To keep multiple applications from sinking your score, only apply for cards you’re confident you’ll qualify for or get prequalified before applying.
Another potential credit impact involves your credit limit. If you transfer a debt balance that makes up nearly your entire credit line, you could increase your credit utilization ratio — the amount of credit you’re using compared to the amount you have available. This is one of the most influential factors in your credit score; the lower it is, the better. However, if you can keep up with your payments and begin to quickly bring down your balance over the intro period, you can mitigate the negative effect and balance the ratio.
What to do if your credit card application is denied
Develop a plan
A good plan is the most important thing you can have before deciding to pay down debt with a balance transfer credit card.
Using your card details (length of intro period, balance transfer fee, etc.), determine precisely how much you need to pay each month to eliminate your balance in full before the 0% APR period ends. If necessary, look at your budget and spending before you apply to find areas where you can reduce spending to dedicate more toward your monthly payments.
If you can't pay off your balance completely, think about what next steps you’ll take once interest kicks in to keep the remainder from growing out of your control.
And don’t forget to rethink your spending over the long term to ensure you don’t wind up with another debt balance in the future. Practicing good credit habits and spending only what you can afford is the best way to take advantage of the rewards and benefits of credit cards without paying the price tag of high interest.
